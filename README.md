**Description**
This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop.

**How It Works:**
The program defines a function factorial(n) that:

Checks if the number is negative.

If negative, returns a message stating that factorial does not exist.

If non-negative, calculates the factorial using a for loop.

The program prompts the user to enter an integer.

It calls the factorial() function with the entered number.

Finally, it prints the calculated factorial or an appropriate error message.

**Example Output:**
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120

**Description**
This Python program prompts the user to enter a number and then uses the built-in math module to perform the following calculations:

Square Root

Natural Logarithm (log base e)

Sine (in radians)

**How It Works:**
The program asks the user to input a number.

It checks if the number is greater than 0 to ensure validity for logarithmic and square root calculations.

If valid, it uses the math module to:

Compute the square root using math.sqrt()

Calculate the natural log using math.log()

Find the sine value using math.sin() (input treated as radians)

It displays all three results to the user.

If the input is zero or negative, it prints a message asking for a positive number.

**Example Output**:

Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
